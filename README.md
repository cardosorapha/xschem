# xschem+photonics
A schematic editor for VLSI/Asic/Analog custom designs, netlist backends for VHDL, Spice and Verilog. The tool is focused on hierarchy and parametric designs, to maximize circuit reuse.

## Photonics

This repository includes new base components for schematic editing photonic integrated circuits, with netlisting and hierarchy capabilities. Currently supporting:

- Waveguides
- Splitters
- Y-Junctions
- Directional Couplers
- Photodetectors
- Clock Sources

New components to be added soon.
